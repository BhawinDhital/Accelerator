3. Twiss parameters and dispersion functions in a dual energy storage ring are attached.
4. The corresponding file "betafunction.gnu" plots beta functions along the beam line.
5. The corresponding file "dispersion.gnu" plots dispersion functions along the beam line.


#To run gnuplot, keep all files and twiss.txt file in the same folder.
#Then type the command "gnuplot dispersion.gnu", just type without " "(gnuplot dispersion.gnu)
